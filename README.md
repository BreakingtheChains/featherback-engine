# featherback-engine
3D game engine written in the D language
https://dlang.org/
Should support both Linux and Windows NT by beta. Mac OS 10 support coming whenever someone decides to port it. Being developed on Ubuntu 17.10, so Linux support comes first.
Written starting March 23, 2018 by BreakingtheChains on Github, Chainbreaker on itch.io. ETA: 2020???
Goal of being easily moddable. Should be easy with the engine code open source, no license required!
